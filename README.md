# Challenge-05

This assignment involves creating a simple calendar application that allows users to add events to each hour of the day. The app will run in a web browser and use jQuery to dynamically update the HTML and CSS. To work with date and time, the Day.js library must be used.

The user story for this assignment involves an employee with a busy schedule who wants to add important events to a daily planner to manage their time effectively. The acceptance criteria specify that when the user opens the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. As the user scrolls down, they will see timeblocks for standard business hours. Each timeblock will be color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.

When the user clicks into a timeblock, they can enter an event, and when they click the save button for that timeblock, the text for that event is saved in local storage. If the user refreshes the page, the saved events will persist.

Overall, this assignment involves creating a functional and user-friendly daily planner application that meets the specified requirements.
